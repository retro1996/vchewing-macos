# Custom Exculded Characters or Symbols (for Plain Bopomofo).
#
# See https://github.com/openvanilla/McBopomofo/wiki/使用手冊#手動刪詞 for usage.
#
# For example, the two lines below will remove the punctuations 〈 and 《 whenever
# you type the character <:
#
#   〈 _punctuation_Standard_<
#   《 _punctuation_Standard_<
#
# Any line that starts with "#" is treated as comment.
